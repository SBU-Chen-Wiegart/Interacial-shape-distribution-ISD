# Interacial-shape-distribution-ISD-

Interfacial shape distribution (ISD) calculation from meshed 3D datasets exported from Avizo/ Amira

Under ‘Input section:’, add necessary information
1. Add file path, e.g., path = r'C:\Users\testfolder’ 
2. Add file name for meshed surface, e.g., filename_mesh = r'test_meshedfile.surf'
3. Add file name for min/ max curvature, e.g., filename_curvatures = r'BothCurvatures.am'
4. Add feature size, unit needs to be consistent with the pixel size. If not need, leave it as 1. The X and Y axis title needs to be changed to k1 and k2.
5. Adjust xbins and ybins based on the data
